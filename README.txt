*Title: 
University Interaction & Notification System

*Description:
This project is designed to help university students and professors interact efficiently. The application for students allows them to receive important notifications such as make-up classes or professor absences. Each student can only view information relevant to their section. Professors have a dedicated app that enables them to view and send notifications to specific student sections.

Additionally, the university director can use a web platform to send advertisements or notifications to be displayed for all students. These ads can also be shown on an Android TV application, which displays faculty events and announcements on the faculty’s digital screens. The TV app scrolls through all the ads sent via the director’s dashboard, ensuring that important messages are visible to everyone in the faculty.
